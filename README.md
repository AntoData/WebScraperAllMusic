 Simple example of a web scraper using python. In this case, we ask the user using the console for the name of a band/artist and using selenium webdriver and beautifulsoup we print information about the discography of that artist/band
For this to work you need to install correctly the libraries used here (beautifulsoup and selenium) and also Chrome webdriver
